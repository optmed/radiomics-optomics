# Use this for feature extraction so that it is thoroughly documented. Note that bin width needs to be
# adjusted for micro-CT (linear attenuation coefficient, 1/cm) and for optical (calibrated reflectance, unitless)

setting:
  binWidth: 0.005             # <--S. Streeter, set 50 kVp linear attenuation coefficient bin width (1/cm) for micro-CT data
  label: 1                    # Mask must contain 1s, convert all non-NaN pixels to 1 for mask
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline' # This is an enumerated value, here None is not allowed
  resampledPixelSpacing:      # This disables resampling, as it is interpreted as None, to enable it, specify spacing in x, y, z as [x, y , z]
  weightingNorm:              # If no value is specified, it is interpreted as None

# Image types to use: "Original" for unfiltered image, for possible filters, see documentation.
imageType:
  Original: {}                # for dictionaries / mappings, None values are not allowed, '{}' is interpreted as an empty dictionary

# Featureclasses, from which features must be calculated. If a featureclass is not mentioned, no features are calculated
# for that class. Otherwise, the specified features are calculated, or, if none are specified, all are calculated (excluding redundant/deprecated features).
featureClass:
  firstorder: 
  glcm:  # Disable SumAverage by specifying all other GLCM features available
